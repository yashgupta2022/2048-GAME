# 2048-GAME
I have developed this 2048 game in Python using Tkinter.

Just Press Arrow Keys to move the all tiles in a direction
and try to combine all sets of two identical tiles to reach the 2048 numbered tile to win the game.

Each Move generates a number-2 tile at a random empty position

* RESET button => Reset the Game if you want to Retry
* EXIT button => To Exit the Window
* SCORE => Displays your current score

After a Win or Lose:-
* Click Ok to RESET
* Click Cancel to EXIT
